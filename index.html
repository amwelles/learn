	<h1>amwelles/learn <span class="subtitle">front-end and theme development</span></h1>

	<p>Hello! I (Autumn) probably directed you here because you asked me what you needed to learn to do what I do for a living. I hope to continually update this and keep it as a running resource for all things code-related.</p>

	<h2>Getting started</h2>

	<p>Even if you've never touched a line of code in your life, you can learn to be a front-end developer. These sites are all great places to start. Some of them (like the Mozilla Developer Network) are a bit overwhelming, but you may find them useful just to glance at for now.</p>

	<h2>Assignments</h2>

	<p>So now that you have some skills, what should you actually <em>do</em> with them? Here are some very open-ended beginner projects that might help you get started down the path to theme development.</p>

	<h3>Create a Tumblr theme</h3>

	<p>Tumblr will introduce a few different concepts to your skillset. You'll learn about variables, some very basic programming logic (if/else statements, loops) and you should use your Tumblr to blog about whatever you're learning. It's great to keep a record so that you're able to go back and reference your own work. You can continue to update your theme and made small adjustments as time goes on.</p>

	<ol>
		<li><a href="http://tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Sign up for a Tumblr account</a> if you don't already have one.</li>
		<li>Visit your Tumblr URL (http://username.tumblr.com).</li>
		<li>Click "Edit theme" in the top, right-hand corner.</li>
		<li>Click "Edit HTML" in the top left sidebar.</li>
		<li>Click the gear in the top left (next to the back arrow).</li>
		<li>Select "Theme documentation" from the dropdown.</li>
		<li>Choose one:
			<ul>
				<li>Use the theme documentation to start from scratch.</li>
				<li>Use <a href="http://dash.generalassemb.ly/tumblr" target="_blank">Dash's tutorial</a> to create a theme.</li>
				<li>Use the <a href="http://buildthemes.tumblr.com/ch1" target="_blank">Build Themes tutorial</a> to create a theme.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Convert a Photoshop document into HTML &amp; CSS</h3>

	<p>Unless you plan on designing <em>and</em> developing every site you create, you'll probably end up working with a Photoshop document that a designer has provided.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Visit <a href="http://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/website-template/" target="_blank">Freebiesbug</a> and download a free PSD website template.</li>
		<li>Start a free 30-day trial of <a href="http://adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a>.</li>
		<li>Block out sections of the site on paper, thinking strategically about how divs will work together. You can do this digitally, but I find it easiest to do with a pen and paper. <a href="images/blocking-example.png" target="_blank">(example)</a></li>
		<li>Write your HTML &amp; CSS to look as close as possible to the Photoshop document.</li>
		<li>Here's a partial example I did. <a href="https://github.com/amwelles/mockup-example">(example)</a></li>
